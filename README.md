<b>A Deep Neural Network Library in MATLAB</b>

This project was made by me and two colleagues: <b>Marco Matarese</b> and <b>Riccardo Grieco</b>. It was the final project for the annual course <i>Machine Learning and Applications</i> at <i>University of Naples Federico II</i>. The comments are written in italian.

Following, the description of the folders inside the project:
<ul>
  <li><b>/</b>: contains all the files to create and train a deep neural network. The learning phase can be achived using two different algorithms: <i>gradient descent</i> or <i>resilient backpropagation</i></li>
  <li><b>/experimentation</b>: different experiments that show how to create and train a deep neural network on MNIST and then how to classify its digits, evaluating the accuracy. Start from here to understand how to use the library.</li>
  <li><b>/functions</b>: contains the implemented mathematical functions, like the <i>cross entropy</i> or the <i>sum of squares</i>. </li>
  <li><b>/mnist</b>: contains the MNIST dataset.</li>
</ul>
